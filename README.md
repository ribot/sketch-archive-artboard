# Sketch Archive Artboard
This plugin archives the current artboard you're on so you can keep iterations of designs without deleting them. Any shared styles are removed so that they don't affect (and are not affected by) your current designs.

# Installation
1. Download the repository using this [link](https://github.com/ribot/sketch-archive-artboard/archive/master.zip)
2. Unzip the files from the ZIP
3. In Sketch 3, select `Plugins > Reveal Plugins Folder...` from the menu bar
4. Put the (downloaded, unzipped) folder in here
5. Rename it `Archive Artboard`

# Usage
1. When you want to archive an artboard, simply run the **Archive Artboard** plugin `(⌃⇧A)`
2. That's it!

# Compatibility
Tested on Sketch 3.2.2
